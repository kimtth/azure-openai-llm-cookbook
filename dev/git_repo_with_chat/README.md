You: Can you explain the repository?

Assistant: The repository "Physics Simulations" contains various physics simulations generated via LLM prompting. It includes HTML files that demonstrate different physical phenomena:

1. **EARTH.HTML:** Simulates Earth with a dipole field tilted at 11 degrees from the Earth's spin axis.
2. **EM-SOLENOID.HTML:** Demonstrates a charged solenoid creating a magnetic field.
3. **GENERAL-RELATIVITY.HTML:** Illustrates Einstein's theory of General Relativity, specifically the curvature of space-time.

To use the simulations, clone the repository and run any HTML file using Live Server. If issues arise, check Dev Tools for errors and use tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Grok for troubleshooting.

The repository also includes a demo GIF and encourages users to follow the creator on X [@renderfiction](https://x.com/renderfiction). The software is provided under an MIT license.
