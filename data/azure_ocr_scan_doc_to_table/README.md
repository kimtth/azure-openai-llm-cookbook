# Table Extraction and Export to Excel  

- This demo utilizes Azure Document Intelligence (formerly Azure Form Recognizer) to extract tables from a document.

- Input: `data\table-page.png` -> Output: `data\table-page.xlsx` The Excel file is the converted result, which contains a table from the input image with the original image attached.

```bash
pip install azure-ai-documentintelligence==1.0.0
